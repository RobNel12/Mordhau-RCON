## [1.14.1] - 2021-08-30

## [1.11.0] - 2021-08-22

### Added

## [1.10.2] - 2021-08-11

### Added

-   You can now toggle ingame (RCON) commands

### Changed

## [1.6.3] - 2021-07-09

### Changed

-   Moved `bannedWords.json` and migration config.json (which is now named `migration.json`) file to root directory of the project
-   Global punishments (`ban` and `mute`) will now override currently applied punishment duration (though if the player is already permanently banned or muted on a server the player's current duration will not be forced)
