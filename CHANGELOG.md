## [1.16.10] - 2021-09-28

### Fixed

-   Hopefully fixed the location issue

## [1.16.9] - 2021-09-26

### Added

-   Added passwordProtected fallback value for the status embed

### Fixed

-   Fixed server name fallback not being used properly (also shows the password-protected status fallback)

## [1.16.8] - 2021-09-26

### Added

-   Added fallback values for the server name (this does allow for all characters to be used), server port (game port), and max player count (check the `example.config.json` file for the structure). These are only used when the server can't be found because of the server name having a symbol or just offline (Note: the worst-case scenario is when the server is offline and the embed status just got generated, then only the location data will be correct, the rest will show "Unknown")

### Changed

-   If RCON connection can't be made to the server, the bot will not make a request to the PlayFab API (saves computing resources)

### Fixed

-   Fixed status embed erroring when the server has a symbol in the name (uses fallback values instead, if they're provided)
-   Fixed location falling back to wrong value (supposed to fallback to United Nations flag but fell back to Unknown)

### Fixed

-   Duplicate interval update strings were used in the status embed footer

## [1.16.4] - 2021-09-21

### Fixed

-   Using server hostname to determine if the server is the same (fixes the optimization that only worked if the status config was on show IP-PORT mode)
-   Display correct location (to not show a rate-limited message)
-   Some grammar issues in changelog (no I will not update the releases' descriptions)

## [1.16.3] - 2021-09-20

### Changed

-   Different approach when sending a new status message (to avoid duplication)
-   Only fetch the location with the API when the server config IP doesn't match the PlayFab API fetched server IP
-   Might have optimized when the bot should fetch new country data for the status message

## [1.16.2] - 2021-09-19

### Added

-   Added status channel permission set (requires the bot to have the manage channel permission)

### Changed

-   The bot will now remove all status messages and send new ones at launch

## [1.14.0] - 2021-08-30

## [1.13.3] - 2021-08-29

### Fixed

-   Forgot to add a simple check for the mention remove function

## [1.12.0] - 2021-08-28

### Fixed

-   Fixed player names being able to mention (message sent by the bot would mention if the player has a mentionable name)

## [1.11.0] - 2021-08-22

### Added

-   Added auto restarter to the auto-updater system

### Fixed

-   Fixed interactions failing by deferring every command (the reason for interactions failing are probably related to some commands taking too long to respond to the interaction. PS: Mystic rekt! üòÅ)
-   Fixed cancel button not checking who pressed the bot (causing the action being canceled)

## [1.10.2] - 2021-08-11

-   `syncServerPunishments` and `global` punishments will fallback to sending a punishment message to every punishment webhook (and permanent) if the server is not found in the bot (should be rare)

### Changed

### Added

-   You can now toggle in-game (RCON) commands

### Changed

## [1.6.3] - 2021-07-09
